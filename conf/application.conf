# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="en"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.user=sa
# db.default.password=""
db.authorization.driver=org.h2.Driver
db.authorization.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
db.authorization.user=sa
db.authorization.password=""


# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# Swagger
# ~~~~~~~
# api.version must not be used in met-api, only in plugins
#api.version="v0"
swagger.api.basepath="http://localhost:9000"
#swagger.filter="security.AuthorisationFilter"
swagger.dir="swagger-2.1.0-M1"

# Plugins
# ~~~~~~~
#include "kdvh.conf"
#application.router=test.Routes # not working as we need a list

# Development
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
mail.override.enabled = true
mail.override.address = "root@localhost"

# You should add a personal configuration file called development.conf in your conf directory
# This should include at least a mail.override.address directive with your own email address
#
include "development.conf"
